## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (for local development)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nba-project

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env files in both backend/ and frontend/

# Start development servers
cd backend && npm run dev
cd ../frontend && npm run dev
```

## Development Notes

- The scraper scripts in `backend/scripts/` are for demonstration purposes only
- All data processing is done offline and results are stored in CSV format
- Machine learning models are pre-trained and deployed as static predictions
- The application uses a hybrid approach: static data files with dynamic API responses

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data updates
- User authentication and personalized dashboards
- Advanced statistical visualizations
- Mobile app development
- Integration with live NBA APIs
